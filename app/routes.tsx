
/*What Should Be in routes.tsx?
For your tab-based Expo Router project with app/(tabs)/index.tsx (Budsjettappen) and app/(tabs)/oversikt.tsx (oversikt), routes.tsx should:

Define a route parameter list (ParamList) for TypeScript to type routes and their parameters.
Export route path constants matching your file structure (e.g., /(tabs)/oversikt).
Optionally include parameter types if your routes accept parameters. */
